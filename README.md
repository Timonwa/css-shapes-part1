### Creating simple shapes using CSS.
#### A personal project to test my CSS skills.
This project is to test my skills in the following by creating shapes using;
- ::before and ::after pseudo elements
- border and box-shadow
- relative and absolute positioning
- CSS transforms also.

The goal is to create 26 unique shapes and more if I can, and through the process, expand my reasoning of finding simplier and easier solutions to each shapes I encounter.
